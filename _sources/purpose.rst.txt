Purpose
=======
This is a straw man project.  I've put it together in order to learn many
aspects of how to manage a project.

Subset of Things I Don't Know
-----------------------------

- How to use `__init__.py`
- How to use `setup.py`
- How to manage versions
- How to handle GitHub issues
- How to manage dependencies
- Whether my testing suite is sufficient
- Whether my documentation is sufficient
- How to use sphinx with some comfortable efficiency

I'm sure to add to this list and provide comments on what I've learned along the
way.

Feedback
--------
I'm hoping that others might find this package useful or fun and I welcome any
and all feedback.  Positive feedback will likely make me feel good.  But
constructive criticism will make me better at stuff.
